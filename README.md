# coolkoi-radii
Stuff from Morton &amp; Swift (2014)

Please forgive the code & organization, though this should all be in principle reproducible.  I've just dumped this into a repo for posterity (was not developed as such).  The most useful thing here will probably be the tabulated tables of the log(period) and radius functions derived in the paper.  Random dependencies in `radiusfn.py` (if for some reason you feel like digging around in the actual code) can be found in my old FPP code repository, which is the old stuff that predated `isochrones`/`vespa`.
